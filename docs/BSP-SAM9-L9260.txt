Board    :  Olimex SAM9-L9260
CPU      :  Atmel AT91SAM9260 ARM9 180MHz, 64MB RAM
Location :  <base>/boards/sam9-l9260

Description:
------------

The sam9-l9260 bsp is for the Olimex SAM9-L9260 Arm Board. Currently, it only
supports the timer and the uart interrupts (drivers are located in file 
<base>/boards/sam9-l9260/drivers.c) which are off the IRQ interrupt on
the ARM processor.

The sam9-l9260 board has 64MB of RAM onboard RAM starting at 0x20000000. U-Boot
users SRAM located at the first 256MB space. Akalon is loaded at 0x20000000 
and currently, it takes about 20K of space. However, 1MB is allocated for
Akalon so that a user can compile in an application of about 980K. The rest
of the space is allocated for the bss section. If this amount (980K) is not
enough for the application, then go to file <base>/boards/sam9-l9260/start.c and
modify the input parameters of the os_init() call in function bsp_pre_init().

Thus the RAM address is as follows (for the rest of the address map, consult
the Atmel AT91SAM9260 docs)..

0x23ffffff <- Top of RAM (bss section)

0x20100000 <- End of the allocated space for the Akalon RTOS
           <- Free space
0x20005xxx <- Currently ending location of the Akalon RTOS

0x20000000 <- Start of the Akalon RTOS

BTW, use the arm-none-eabi-nm -n command to get the Akalon RTOS map.


Tools:
------

Host     : Linux

Akalon   : 2014-1011

Compiler : GCC 4.2.3 (Codesourcery Version 2008q1-126). The compiler was
           provided by Olimex. The executables are from the arm-none-eabi 
           family -- or --

           GCC 4.8.3 (Sourcery CodeBench Lite 2014.05-28 4.8.3 20140320
           (prerelease)  

Linker   : GNU ld (Codesourcery Version 2008q1-126) 2.18.50.2008215 -- or --
           GNU ld (Sourcery CodeBench Lite 2014.05-28) 2.24.51.20140217


Target   : Olimex SAM9-L9260 with a Serial and Ethernet connection (Ethernet
           connection is used for loading the Akalon RTOS binary image). 

Loader   : U-Boot Version 1.3.4-00001-g8ed2f5f-dirty (Aug 20 2008 - 18:26:55)



Building Akalon:
----------------

   a. Set the location of the tools directory by modifying the TOOL_DIR 
      variable in file <base>/boards/sam9-l9260/Makefile 

      For example, my TOOL_DIR was...

      TOOL_DIR=~/Olimex/bin/codesourcery-armgcc-2008q1/bin

      *** NOTE *** Before compiling, TOOL_DIR and LIB_DIR needs to be set.

   b. Change to the bsp directory
      $ cd <base>/boards/sam9-l9260

   c. To build
      $ make all

      To clean and build
      $ make clean all

      - The built binary is named akalon-sam9-l9260-926ejs.bin

      Note: By default, the Akalon RTOS will be built in directory 
      <base>/boards/sam9-l9260/bld. This default directory can be changed by
      modifying the BLD_DIR variable in file <base>/boards/sam9-l9260/Makefile.


Loading:
--------
The Akalon RTOS for the SAM9-L9260 is loaded by the U-Boot bootloader from a
tftp server. BTW, U-Boot is already preloaded by Olimex on SAM9-L9260 cards.
To load the Akalon RTOS...

    a. Setup a tftp server (out of scope for this document)

    b. Copy the Akalon RTOS binary akalon-sam9-l9260-926ejs.bin to the
       directory where the tftp server looks for files

    c. Connect an Ethernet cable and a Serial cable to the Olimex SAM9-L9260 
       board and the Host computer.

    d. Bring up a Serial Console on the Host computer and set the baud rate 
       to 115200

    e. Power On the SAM9-L9260 Board.

    f. Stop the boot countdown and set the IP address of the tftp server on 
       the SAM9-L9260 U-Boot bootloader. 

       U-Boot> setenv serverip <tftp server ip address>
       U-Boot> saveenv

       The IP address of the SAM9-L9206 board can also be set with...

       U-Boot> setenv ipaddr <board ip address>

    g. Load the Akalon RTOS          

       U-Boot> tftpboot 0x20000000 akalon-sam9-l9260-926ejs.bin

Executing:
----------

At the U-Boot Prompt, execute the akalon-sam9-l9260-926ejs.bin binary by...

      $ go 0x20000000
